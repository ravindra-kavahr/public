We can export and import our modules in NodeJS

Below is the syntax to export a single method

module.exports = methodName(or property)

We can also export multiple properties using an object notation, below is an example

module.exports = {
 	methodName1,
	methodName2
}

We can achieve the same results with the below syntax as well. It's recommended syntax.

module.exports.methodName1 = methodName1;
module.exports.methodName2 = methodName2;

We also have an alias for module.exports, which is just exports. However, when using exports directly we can't do exports = methodName, we have to do exports.methodName = methodName (Or function directly).
