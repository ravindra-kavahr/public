REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop.

Whenever we enter node in our terminal(assuming it is installed and path variables are set) we enter REPL.

Here we can try all the commands/write code which we can in a normal JS file which node will execute. This is a really nice playground for testing out different node features.
