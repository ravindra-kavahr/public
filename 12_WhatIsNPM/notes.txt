npm stands for node packet manager

Without npm, we can still use third-party modules. However, it would be  error-prone. 

It provides many challenges like how to maintain the right versions, and how to share our project with the right dependencies with other developers.

We have package.json file in node projects that contains all the data related to third party node modules that we may want to use in our project.

npm is also a cli utility that can be used to download all the modules mentioned in package.json using below command.

npm install (or "npm i" in short)
