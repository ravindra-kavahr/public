Official Definition is - NodeJS is a JavaScript(JS) runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine

Every browser has a JS engine that executes our client-side code. 
The speed of our code execution is influenced by the implementation of the engine.
Chrome's V8 engine is one of the fastest engines. So using it was an obvious choice for building node.
Usually, the V8 engine only has browser context. However, with NodeJS it changes.

We can use the V8 engine with different contexts, which provides it access to the file system and all other services.

Different system resources include memory, file system, IO, network, etc.
